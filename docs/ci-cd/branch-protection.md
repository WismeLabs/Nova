# üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Setup

> **How to prevent broken code from reaching your main branches**

## üéØ **Why You Need This**
- Prevents developers from pushing broken code directly to `main` or `beta`
- Forces all changes to go through PRs and quality checks
- Keeps your main branches stable and deployable

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **GitHub Settings to Configure**

### 1. **Go to Repository Settings**
- Navigate to your Nova repository on GitHub
- Click **Settings** tab
- Click **Branches** in the left sidebar

### 2. **Protect `main` Branch**
Click **Add rule** and configure:

```
Branch name pattern: main

‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  Search for: "Error Prevention Check" (from quality-check.yml)

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
‚úÖ Include administrators (recommended for small teams)
```

### 3. **Protect `beta` Branch**
Repeat the same for `beta` branch with slightly relaxed rules:

```
Branch name pattern: beta

‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1 (can be 0 for faster development)

‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  Search for: "Error Prevention Check"

‚úÖ Include administrators
```

## üöÄ **Result: Protected Workflow**

### **What Developers Can Do:**
```bash
‚úÖ Create feature branches from beta
‚úÖ Push to feature branches
‚úÖ Open PRs to beta or main
```

### **What Developers CANNOT Do:**
```bash
‚ùå Push directly to main
‚ùå Push directly to beta  
‚ùå Merge PR without quality checks passing
‚ùå Merge PR without approval
```

### **Typical Workflow:**
```bash
1. git checkout beta
2. git checkout -b feat/my-feature
3. # Make changes
4. git push origin feat/my-feature
5. # Open PR to beta
6. # Wait for quality check ‚úÖ
7. # Get approval from teammate
8. # Merge PR
```

## üîß **Small Team Recommendations**

### **For Development Speed:**
- `beta` branch: Require quality checks but allow self-merge
- `main` branch: Require quality checks + 1 approval

### **For Extra Safety:**
- Both branches: Require quality checks + 1 approval
- Dismiss stale approvals on new commits

### **Quality Check Status:**
Make sure "Error Prevention Check" is required:
- This is the job name from `quality-check.yml`
- It ensures code compiles, tests pass, and lint passes
- No PR can merge without this passing

## üéØ **Benefits for Your Team**

‚úÖ **Prevents Broken Builds**
- No more "who broke the build?" moments
- Quality checks catch errors before merge

‚úÖ **Maintains Code Quality**
- Lint checks prevent sloppy code
- Test requirements catch bugs early

‚úÖ **Encourages Code Review**
- Required approvals mean fresh eyes on code
- Knowledge sharing between team members

‚úÖ **Safe Deployment**
- `main` branch is always deployable
- `beta` branch is stable for testing

## üö® **Emergency Override (Use Sparingly)**

As admin, you can still:
- Force push to protected branches (if enabled)
- Merge without status checks (in emergency)
- Bypass approval requirements

**When to use:**
- Hotfix for critical production bug
- CI system is down but code is verified safe
- Emergency deployment needed

**Remember:** Use these overrides only when absolutely necessary!

## üìã **Quick Setup Checklist**

- [ ] Go to Repository Settings > Branches
- [ ] Add protection rule for `main` branch
- [ ] Add protection rule for `beta` branch  
- [ ] Require "Error Prevention Check" status
- [ ] Set approval requirements (1 person recommended)
- [ ] Test with a dummy PR to verify it works

**That's it!** Your branches are now protected and your code quality is automatically enforced. üõ°Ô∏è
