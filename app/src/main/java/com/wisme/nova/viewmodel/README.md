# ViewModels

This folder contains ViewModels for state management and connecting UI to business logic.

## Suggested Structure:
```
viewmodel/
├── AuthViewModel.kt
├── PodcastViewModel.kt
├── PlayerViewModel.kt
└── ProfileViewModel.kt
```

ViewModels should be feature-based and handle UI state and user interactions.
